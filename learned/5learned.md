# Styling

## Base exercise

JSX uses `className` instead of `class` and style is an object instead of a
string

## Extra credit 1

Stop empty string to stop `undefined` being passed though on template literal
Favour forwarding props instead of using children allows us to be more flexalbe.

## Extra credit 2

Favour a simple API and make the styling (inline, className) an implentation
detail of the box component. Even in final solution still offer passing
`className` so that the component is flexable to work in different use cases not
just options offered out of the box.
